## Getting Started

Spoken word recognizer is a project given by instructor within the course. The general outline of the project is about training the computer voice input to understand English words (i.e. digits) through Python. 

### Prerequisites

The program is coded in Python 2.7. We highly recommend using virtualenv to install and run the program without any issue. virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environment. By using it, you can avoid any interference that might be a problem because of your previous Python packages.
